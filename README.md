# Deep Learning for EEG Signals Analysis :brain:

Survey on state of the art Deep Learning (DL) methods for EEG signal analysis, done during the course Control of Autonomouos and Multi-Agent Systems at Sapienza University of Rome.


The report is organized as follows: 
* In section II, a theoretical introduction of EEG signal processing is provided. 
* In section III a summary which investigates the most common DL architectures in EEG-based applications is described. 
* Section IV explores a series of meaningful applications which make use of EEG signals. 
* In section V and VI EEG-based methodsfor epileptic seizure and Alzheimerâ€™s disease detection tasks are deeply described, respectively. 
* Finally, section VII concerns the conclusions.
